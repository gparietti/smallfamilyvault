# smallfamilyvault
 With this project, only your family members will be able to view the files you decide to share. Eh, it's not that simple because the python super system will deny access to non-family members.
NOTE: 
In the comments of the program it is written when you can change the password or the answer to the security question. To change it you just have to remember to change the relevant question and replace the one written between "" with the new answer.
Advice:
After logging in, where you can find the writing that you can add your own things, you can (for example) insert a link that leads to a site containing the files.
To put it, you need to add a library and a line of code.

*IF IN MANY YOU FIND IT USEFUL, COMMENT THE PROJECT AND I WILL UPLOAD THE VERSION WITH THE LINK.
